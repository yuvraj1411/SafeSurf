SafeSurf: AI-Powered Safety Browser üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
SafeSurf is a Python-based web browser built with PyQt6 and Flask, designed for child safety. It includes features to protect users from malicious and inappropriate content, giving parents a clear overview of their child's online activity.

‚ú® Features
Parental Controls: Easily add websites to a blacklist to block them or a whitelist to restrict browsing to only approved sites.

Hate Speech Detection: An integrated machine learning model analyzes page content in real-time, blocking pages flagged for hateful or offensive language.

Real-time Threat Protection: Uses Google Safe Browsing and VirusTotal APIs to check URLs for malware, phishing, and other security threats before a page loads.

AI-Powered Insights: A dedicated dashboard uses the Google Gemini API to analyze browsing history and provide parents with friendly, actionable insights into their child's online interests and activity.

Local Web Dashboard: A built-in web server (via Flask) provides a user-friendly dashboard to manage parental controls, view browsing history, and see security alerts.

Inappropriate Image Detection: (Conceptual) The browser includes a function to analyze image URLs for nudity, providing an alert if potentially inappropriate images are detected.
